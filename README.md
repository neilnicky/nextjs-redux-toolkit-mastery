Repo Name: nextjs-redux-toolkit-mastery
Branching Strategy:
Follow this naming format for branches:
feature/01-basic-setup, feature/02-redux-core, feature/03-async-actions, etc.
🔵 Stage 1: Redux Core Concepts (Under the Hood)
👉 Goal: Understand the fundamentals of Redux and how Redux Toolkit simplifies it.

📝 Learning Concepts:
Store – How Redux stores state.
Actions – What are actions, how they are dispatched.
Reducers – Pure functions for handling state changes.
Middleware – What middleware is and how it works.
DevTools Integration – How Redux DevTools work.
🔧 Git Branch: feature/01-core-redux
📂 Tasks to Implement:
Set up a basic Next.js project using App Router.
Create a Redux store manually using configureStore.
Add a counter slice with increment, decrement, and reset actions.
Manually dispatch actions in a simple component.
Connect Redux DevTools.
🔵 Stage 2: Slices & Reducers
👉 Goal: Understand how Redux Toolkit abstracts reducers and actions into slices.

📝 Learning Concepts:
createSlice – How to use it to manage state.
Reducers & Actions – Auto-generated actions from slices.
Selectors – How to extract data from the store.
🔧 Git Branch: feature/02-slices
📂 Tasks to Implement:
Create multiple slices (e.g., counterSlice, authSlice).
Use selectors to retrieve specific pieces of state.
Subscribe to store updates using selectors.
🔵 Stage 3: Middleware (Under the Hood)
👉 Goal: Understand how Redux middlewares work and how to create custom middlewares.

📝 Learning Concepts:
Built-in Middleware – redux-thunk, logger.
Custom Middleware – How to write your own.
Enhancers – Understanding how enhancers modify the store.
🔧 Git Branch: feature/03-middleware
📂 Tasks to Implement:
Integrate redux-logger middleware.
Write a custom middleware that logs every dispatched action.
Implement an error-handling middleware.
🔵 Stage 4: Async Actions (Thunks & Async Logic)
👉 Goal: Learn how to handle async logic with Redux Toolkit's createAsyncThunk.

📝 Learning Concepts:
createAsyncThunk – How to handle async actions.
Pending, Fulfilled, Rejected States – Understanding lifecycle states.
Error Handling – Handle errors from async operations.
🔧 Git Branch: feature/04-async-actions
📂 Tasks to Implement:
Create an async thunk to fetch data from an API (e.g., fetch users).
Handle loading, success, and error states.
Show different UI states based on the thunk status.
🔵 Stage 5: Redux Toolkit with Next.js (App Router)
👉 Goal: Master Redux Toolkit integration with Next.js App Router.

📝 Learning Concepts:
Provider Setup – Using ReduxProvider with App Router.
Server Components + Redux – Using Redux in a hybrid SSG/SSR app.
State Hydration – Handling initial state hydration.
🔧 Git Branch: feature/05-nextjs-integration
📂 Tasks to Implement:
Set up the ReduxProvider in app/layout.tsx.
Use Redux state in both server and client components.
Implement state hydration for SSR.
🔵 Stage 6: Advanced Redux Patterns
👉 Goal: Dive into advanced patterns for Redux Toolkit.

📝 Learning Concepts:
Modular Redux Architecture – Organizing large Redux apps.
Dynamic Slices – Adding reducers dynamically at runtime.
Custom Hooks – Create custom hooks to use Redux state and actions.
🔧 Git Branch: feature/06-advanced-patterns
📂 Tasks to Implement:
Create a modular architecture for Redux.
Implement dynamic reducers.
Create custom hooks like useAppSelector and useAppDispatch.
🔵 Stage 7: Testing Redux Toolkit
👉 Goal: Learn how to test Redux slices, thunks, and middlewares.

📝 Learning Concepts:
Unit Testing Slices – Testing reducers and actions.
Testing Thunks – Mocking API calls.
Testing Middlewares – Ensuring middleware works correctly.
🔧 Git Branch: feature/07-testing
📂 Tasks to Implement:
Write tests for reducers and actions.
Test async thunks with mocked API calls.
Test custom middleware.
🔵 Stage 8: Performance Optimization
👉 Goal: Learn how to optimize Redux performance.

📝 Learning Concepts:
Memoizing Selectors – Using reselect for performance.
Avoiding Re-Renders – Using React.memo and useSelector correctly.
Immutable Updates – Ensuring state is updated immutably.
🔧 Git Branch: feature/08-performance-optimization
📂 Tasks to Implement:
Use reselect to memoize selectors.
Optimize component performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.
Implement immutable updates using Immer.js.
🔵 Stage 9: Code Review & Final Project
👉 Goal: Consolidate everything you've learned by building a real-world app.

🔧 Git Branch: feature/09-final-project
📂 Tasks to Implement:
Build a Todo App with features like:
CRUD operations.
Async actions to fetch data.
State hydration in Next.js.
Middleware for error handling.
🛠 Additional Tools to Explore
Immer.js – Used by Redux Toolkit for immutable updates.
Reselect – For memoizing selectors.
Redux DevTools – Understand how to debug effectively.
